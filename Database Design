Database Design:

Database: MongoDB
Database Type: NoSQL Key-Value

Mongo utilizes JSON to store data in a key-value format.
We will be using pymongo to interact with the database
Data will be stored automatically through POST requests to our web app

We will have one database with two collections

Tweets: Used to store useful information about tweets.

_id - ID of tweet entry
text - Text of the tweet
coords - Most relevant coordinates
screenName - username
date - Date tweet posted (WEEKDAY MONTH DAY HH:MM:SS +0000 YEAR)
request_id - request ID with which this tweet was retrieved
keywords - keywords in request relevant to tweet
hashtags - hashtags in request relevant to tweet

Requests: Used to store requests made on web app

keywords - array of keywords
hashtag - requested hashtag
users - requested user
date - date of request
strict - boolean, returns only tweets matching all specified keywords and hashtags

Relations - The purpose of relations would be to reuse tweets from previous requests. For example a request 

{keywords: ["oil", "energy", "crude"],
 hashtag: "",
 users: ""
 date: 10-31-2016 13:04:52
 strict: false}

 returns tweets matching either keyword or both. The tweets would then be stored with their relevant keywords.
 if strict were turned on, then every returned tweet would contain be stored with "oil", "energy", "crude". Someone else
 searching for "oil" will be given data from past tweets tagged just "oil" from past searches.
